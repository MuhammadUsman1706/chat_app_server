1) Prisma will automatically create a database thorugh the model, we don't have to write queries
2) @id means unique value (primary key) where as @default(autoincrement()) means it is added and incremented by computer automatically
3) DateTime @default(now()) means computer will automatically enter current time
4) More Info about data types in prisma: "https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases/using-prisma-migrate-typescript-postgres"
5) npx prisma db push <--- to push the table in the SQL database
6) Can also view your database on "npx prisma studio" like xampp
7) npx prisma db push <--- again to save changes
8) npm innstall @prisma/client <--- for resolvers
9) Go to CRUD prisma for more info on creating users

Q: Why the JWT (token)?
Ans: The token is kept by the client (React-App in our case) as a sign that the user is logged in. Whenever a user tries to fetch a protected resourse (say, a list of all users), it needs to attach JWT in a header with the request, so that server can verify it and allow user to access the protected resourse.

10) receiver User @relation(fields: [receiverId], references: [id]) <--- this line is to create relation between receiverId in message table and id in the user table

11) In typeDefs, for date, scalar means that it will have only one value, whereas type has multiple values i.e. non-scalar. Note: String will work just fine for createdDate as well!
